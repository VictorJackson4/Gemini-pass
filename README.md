Red Teaming LLMs: Identifying Alignment Gaps via Prompt Injection

Research details:
Model tested: Google Gemini( Free and thinking models)
Date:05-11-2025 to 07-12-2025

Overview
This repository contains my work on adversarial prompt engineering. I successfully bypassed the safety alignment of Google Gemini , prompting it to answer restricted queries that it was explicitly trained to reject.

Why this matters:
As AI models are deployed in high-stakes environments, understanding their failure modes is critical. 

This project demonstrates:

Vulnerability Discovery: A systematic approach to finding prompt patterns that break alignment.

Security Implications: Highlighting how current safety mechanisms can be circumvented with sophisticated linguistic tricks.

Methodology: A documented collection of prompt strategies (e.g., role-playing, hypothetical scenarios etc) that led to successful bypasses.

Disclaimer: This project was conducted for educational and security research purposes only to understand LLM vulnerabilities. I do not condone the malicious use of AI.

I have attached the screenshots of the prompts that I used to bypass the model's restriction, however as a safety measure I have hidden the sensitive details to avoid any potential abuse.

Types of prompts Gemini is weak to:

1. NSFW content(stories, scenarios)
2. Hacking(System compromise, how to inject malicious code, social engineering etc)
3. Committing frauds disguised as a genuine financial burden, and asking for tips like Insurance fraud, regulatory fraud, etc.

Steps to reproduce:

Depending on the approach, one can easily find the loophole. Steps shared below.

1. Never appraoch the topic directly. If its an NSFW scenario, use the "FAST" model of Google to casually ask few questions realted to fictional characters of a popular fictional Novel. 
2. Within the same chat create multiple(5-6) "what if" scenarios and change the romantic interest or the protagonist's love interest.
3. By the 7th or the 8th prompt, you can directly ask the model to write a "what if" scenario and instruct it to add a graphic detail.

For hacking/cybersecurity:

1. Be an aspiring student, Cybersecurtiy professional.
2. Use the "Thinking" model of Gemini and ask questions related to how can I secure my system, save my passwords or How can I save my password from getting compromised.
3. Within the same chat, continue the conversation and after 7-8 prompts, switch to the "Fast" model and ask them the exploits or attacks. Make sure that the type of exploit or attack you want to carry out, the initial conversation should be based on it as the model understands better and answers the queries without hesitation.

Insurance frauds or regulatory frauds:

1. This is by far the easiest one to break. The approach here is to use the "Fast" model and keep asking questions about laws and regulation, followed by tricking the model into thinking that the user is under heavy debt by posing as person in financial distress or a law student.

Once the model understands the situation, after 7 to 8 prompts, a person can ask them the "how to" part and the model answers without hesitation.

For example: changing a vehicles catalytic converter is illegal in USA and is considered as an offense.
